# **Twitter Enterprise Data (Gnip) - Python Library**

######  _* Please note that a Gnip console account is needed to access these endpoints *_ 

Welcome to the Twitter Data sample script library for Python.

This library will allow you to access several of our historical and real-time enterprise-level endpoints with Python 3.

## **_To run a script:_**

*1.)*   Ensure you're using the appropriate version of Python (this library supports Python 3).

*2.)*   In the desired sample script enter your Gnip console credentials towards the top of the file in the _UN_ and _PWD_ fields.

*3.)*   In the base_url field toward the top of the file please replace _INSERT_ACCOUNT_NAME_HERE_ and _INSERT_STREAM_LABEL_HERE_ with your account name and stream label, respectively. 

*4.)*   After you've started your virtual environment, run ```python <<REPLACE_THIS_WITH_THE_SAMPLE_SCRIPT_NAME.py>>``` in your terminal.


After completing step 4, you should see the results of your script print out in the terminal.
